# Lagrange's four-square calculator

Every natural number can be represented as follows:
$$
N = a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2\\
$$

$$
\text{($a, b, c, d$ are inegers.)}
$$

**Lagrange's four-square theorem**, also known as **Bachet's conjecture**, states that *every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares.* ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem))

This algorithm can calculate one of the below:
* **an arbitrary solution** of any non-negative integer $N$ by **randomized polynomial time.**
* **an optimal solution**, which use the fewest numbers, of any non-negative integer $N$ by $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt[4]{N})$.

The randomized polynomial algorithm is [based on MICHAEL 0. RABIN et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpa.3160390713)

## Demostration and explanation

You can run the algorithm on [GitHub-Pages](https://powergee.github.io/four-square-sum/), which is implemented by React and Rust(Wasm). **There is also a short explanation about the background.**

## Deploy on local

Rust `cargo` and Node.js environment must be pre-installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/powergee/four-square-sum.git
cd ./four-square-sum

npm run build:wasm  # Build the rust module by wasm-pack
npm install         # Install dependencies and compiled wasm module
npm start           # Start local server
```
